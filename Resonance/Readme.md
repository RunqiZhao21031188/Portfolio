# Brief

This project, featuring the re-creation of historical Chinese culture, such as the Chinese zodiac, is an interactive image installation based on machine learning. It is our sincere expectation that the traditional culture which is gradually neglected will regain its popularity, and meanwhile, get more people to enjoy the heritage of Chinese culture.

To shatter the monotony of traditional Chinese culture (zodiac, shadow puppet, paper cutting, etc.), this project is designed with modern design methods and cultural connotations. By using machine learning tools to interact with the participants, the project revives the traditional Chinese zodiac culture and traditional culture in a new form. It fully reflects the strong collision between tradition and modernity and endows traditional culture with a new romantic visual experience. 


# Design Process

The melodious sound of the guzheng will be heard when people approach the installation. Upon entering, visitors can learn their Chinese zodiac sign and the corresponding gesture for interacting with the device by referring to the reference table. By using hand shadows to simulate animal images for interaction, the project is more like a childhood game than hand shadows, putting the experience at ease and brimming with joy. When ResNet recognizes the corresponding image (hand shadow), a specially designed animation and sound of the corresponding zodiac sign will be displayed on the screen. 

The audience is immersed through physical interaction with visual and auditory sense, leaving the audience wanting more. Resonance features a complete feedback and reward system. Among them, the feedback mechanism allows the audience to judge whether they are right or wrong to imitate the hand shadow, and the reward mechanism refers to the interactive feedback between sound and vision after recognizing the correct action. Different animals correspond to different animations, visual effects and sounds, inspiring the audience's desire to complete the next gesture.
